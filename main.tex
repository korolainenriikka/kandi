%% REFERENCES
%% Some notes on bibliography usage and options:
%% natbib -> you can use, e.g., \citep{} or \parencite{} for (Einstein, 1905); with APA \cite -> Einstein, 1905 without ()
%% maxcitenames=2 -> only 2 author names in text citations, if more -> et al. is used
%% maxbibnames=99 as no great need to suppress the biliography list in a thesis
%% for more information see biblatex package documentation, e.g., from https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex 

%% Reference style:
%% for numeric = Vancouver style -> [1] use:
\usepackage[style=numeric,bibstyle=numeric,backend=biber,natbib=true,maxbibnames=99,giveninits=true,uniquename=init]{biblatex}

\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}
% in case you want the final delimiter between authors & -> (Einstein & Zweistein, 1905) 
% \renewcommand{\finalnamedelim}{ \& }
% List the authors in the Bibilipgraphy as Lastname F, Familyname G,
\DeclareNameAlias{sortname}{family-given}
% remove the punctuation between author names in Bibliography 
%\renewcommand{\revsdnamepunct}{ }

%% Your actual text starts here. You shouldn't mess with the code above the line except
%% to change the parameters. Removing the abstract and ToC commands will mess up stuff.

%% You may wish to include material to avoid browsing the definitions
