abstract = {Research in the Internet of Things (IoT) conceives a world where everyday objects
are connected to the Internet and exchange, store, process, and collect data from
the surrounding environment. IoT devices are becoming essential for supporting the
delivery of data to enable electronic services, but they are not sufficient in most
cases to host application services directly due to their intrinsic resource constraints.
Fog Computing (FC) can be a suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it
can coexist and cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward
the network edge. In this way, it is possible to distribute resources and services
of computing, storage, and networking along the Cloud-to-Things continuum. As such,
FC brings all the benefits of Cloud Computing (CC) closer to end (user) devices. This
article presents a survey on the employment of FC to support IoT devices and services.
The principles and literature characterizing FC are described, highlighting six IoT
application domains that may benefit from the use of this paradigm. The extension
of Cloud systems towards the network edge also creates new challenges and can have
an impact on existing approaches employed in Cloud-based deployments. Research directions
being adopted by the community are highlighted, with an indication of which of these
are likely to have the greatest impact. An overview of existing FC software and hardware
platforms for the IoT is also provided, along with the standardisation efforts in
this area initiated by the OpenFog Consortium (OFC).},

abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.}

abstract = {Every day, huge volumes of sensory, transactional, and web data are continuously generated
as streams, which need to be analyzed online as they arrive. Streaming data can be
considered as one of the main sources of what is called big data. While predictive
modeling for data streams and big data have received a lot of attention over the last
decade, many research approaches are typically designed for well-behaved controlled
problem settings, overlooking important challenges imposed by real-world applications.
This article presents a discussion on eight open challenges for data stream mining.
Our goal is to identify gaps between current research and meaningful applications,
highlight open problems, and define new application-relevant research directions for
data stream mining. The identified challenges cover the full cycle of knowledge discovery
and involve such problems as: protecting data privacy, dealing with legacy systems,
handling incomplete and delayed information, analysis of complex data, and evaluation
of stream mining algorithms. The resulting analysis is illustrated by practical applications
and provides general suggestions concerning lines of future research in data stream

abstract = {Learning from evolving streaming data has become a 'hot' research topic in the last
decade and many adaptive learning algorithms have been developed. This research was
stimulated by rapidly growing amounts of industrial, transactional, sensor and other
business data that arrives in real time and needs to be mined in real time. Under
such circumstances, constant manual adjustment of models is in-efficient and with
increasing amounts of data is becoming infeasible. Nevertheless, adaptive learning
models are still rarely employed in business applications in practice. In the light
of rapidly growing structurally rich 'big data', new generation of parallel computing
solutions and cloud computing services as well as recent advances in portable computing
devices, this article aims to identify the current key research directions to be taken
to bring the adaptive learning closer to application needs. We identify six forthcoming
challenges in designing and building adaptive learning (pre-diction) systems: making
adaptive systems scalable, dealing with realistic data, improving usability and trust,
integrat-ing expert knowledge, taking into account various application needs, and
moving from adaptive algorithms towards adaptive tools. Those challenges are critical
for the evolving stream settings, as the process of model building needs to be fully
automated and continuous.},

abstract = {Most data mining research is concerned with building high-quality classification models
in isolation. In massive production systems, however, the ability to monitor and maintain
performance over time while growing in size and scope is equally important. Many external
factors may degrade classification performance including changes in data distribution,
noise or bias in the source data, and the evolution of the system itself. A well-functioning
system must gracefully handle all of these. This paper lays out a set of design principles
for large-scale autonomous data mining systems and then demonstrates our application
of these principles within the m6d automated ad targeting system. We demonstrate a
comprehensive set of quality control processes that allow us monitor and maintain
thousands of distinct classification models automatically, and to add new models,
take on new data, and correct poorly-performing models without manual intervention
or system disruption.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) are complementary advances: ML
techniques unlock the potential of IoT with intelligence, and IoT applications increasingly
feed data collected by sensors into ML models, thereby employing results to improve
their business processes and services. Hence, orchestrating ML pipelines that encompass
model training and implication involved in the holistic development lifecycle of an
IoT application often leads to complex system integration. This article provides a
comprehensive and systematic survey of the development lifecycle of ML-based IoT applications.
We outline the core roadmap and taxonomy and subsequently assess and compare existing
standard techniques used at individual stages.},
