This literature review aims to survey existing machine learning IoT systems and lifelong learning set-ups to find optimal system architecture for the case presented.

The design decisions that are best suited for the case are presented, and in addition to them it is discussed, which requirements led to which decisions to give insight on how lifelong learning could be facilitated in similar systems.
