A common problem with creating successful large-scale machine learning systems is the fact that significant effort is needed to keep the system working over long periods of time. This is mainly caused by unpreparedness to changes in the data source, a phenomenon known as concept drift. In order to adapt to these drifts, advanced and case-tailored maintenance schemes are needed.

This thesis searches for efficient model updating schemes to bring machine learning to the maritime domain, to applications such as traffic forecasting. Given the model type, recurrent neural networks, and case-specific requirements, such as large data and comparatively loose end-to-end latency requirements, the optimal drift-coping methods are searched for.

Based on literature, it is found that monitoring both models and data, optimizing neural network training using data parallelism and network approximation, and versioning data with an identifier-based mechanism would most likely enable consistent accuracy of the models despite environmental changes. However, it is found that for many approaches, the usability for the specific case cannot be determined without the experimental benchmarking of several options.
