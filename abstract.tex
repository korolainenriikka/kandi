%1st paragraph: on knowledge retention

Adapting machine learning models to evolving tasks and environments is a promising field with a multitude of approaches. Research topics such as lifelong learning, transfer learning, adaptive, and federated learning, are each advancing rapidly. Therefore, a valid question to ask is which ones are as of date mature enough for read world adoption, under which conditions, and which setting.

%2nd paragraph: the thesis investigating the case of maritime
This literature review compares these approaches from the point of view of the maritime domain and its specific characteristics of high geographical distribution, voluminous data, and less-than-instant speed requirements. After determining the optimal approach, its implications on the system architecture, stream processing, training system, and deployment scheme, are presented. A special emphasis is put in thorough arguing why the decisions presented should be made, and taking practical matters such as system maintainability into account.

%3rd paragraph: results and wider motivation
In the review it is found that in the case studied the ... knowledge retention approach is ideal, and therefore a xxx architecture for stream processing,  ... for model training, and ... for the deployment scheme are the ideal ones. %add here: more motivation.

%also: what is mature to implement, what is not, currently, and which immature ones would be the most rewarding in a real world scenario.
