% 1st paragraph: summarized: what is this thesis about, motivation also
A common problem with creating successful large-scale machine learning systems is the fact that significant effort is needed to keep the system working over long periods of time. This is mainly caused by unpreparedness to changes in the data source, a phenomenon known as concept drift. In order to adapt to these drifts, advanced and case-tailored maintenance schemes are needed.

% 2nd paragraph prepares readers to follow
This thesis searches for efficient model updating schemes for the case of bringing machine learning to the maritime domain, to applications such as traffic forecasting. Given the model type, recurrent neural networks, and case-specific requirements, such as large data and comparatively loose end-to-end latency requirements, the optimal drift-coping methods are searched for.

% 3rd paragraph: results and implication (conclusions summary essentially)
Based on literature it is found that monitoring  both models and data, optimizing neural network training using data parallelism and network approximation and versioning data with an   identifier-based mechanism would most likely enable consistent accuracy of the models despite environment changes. However, it is found that for many approaches the usability for the specific case cannot be determined without experimental benchmarking of several options.  %add here: more motivation.
