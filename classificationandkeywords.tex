title wordplay:

Sensor data systems at extreme scale / for scale

Enabling knowledge retention in a sensor-based machine learning big data system: a case study

%knowledge retention is a bad term for this because we are not really aiming for retaining knowledge but enabling the models to be accurate across an extended lifespan

computer systems organization muut
information systems muut

siis voi olla
computer systems organization -> real time systems -> real time system specification, real time system architecture X
information systems -> information systems applications -> spatial-temporal systems -> sensor networks, data streaming X
information systems -> information systems applications -> decision support systems -> Expert systems, data analytics, online analytical processing X
information systems -> information systems applications -> data mining -> data stream mining, clusteringX

siis saleee
computing methodologies -> machine learning -> learning settings -> batch learning, active learning settings, learning from implicit feedback
